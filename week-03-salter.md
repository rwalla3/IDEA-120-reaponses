<!--Describing Gesamstkunstwerk-->

> "We need not, however dwell on Wagner the composer or as the theorist of the *Gesamtkunstwerk*, although obviously such a concept plays a key role in making sense of our utterly confusing, multisensory, audiovisual media society of the present. **I want here to focus on Wagner as an** ==experience architect== **of a machine that utilized the technologies of the time to create unprecedented control over the perceptual and affective experience of his spectators.**" (p. 2)  

I think an example of this concept from the Rhizome Anthology is Exonemo's *Natural Process*.
