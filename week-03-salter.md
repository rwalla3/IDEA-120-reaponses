<!--Describing Gesamstkunstwerk-->

> "We need not, however dwell on Wagner the composer or as the theorist of the *Gesamtkunstwerk*, although obviously such a concept plays a key role in making sense of our utterly confusing, multisensory, audiovisual media society of the present. I want here to focus on Wagner as an **experience architect** of a machine that utilized the technologies of the time to **create unprecedented control over the perceptual and affective experience of his spectators.**" (p. 2)  

<!--Contemporary toos for creating a Gesamstkunstwerk-->

I feel like there must be an infinite number of ways to combine tools and be an "experience architect". I can't help but think an "experience architect" would be called a "designer" today. The design process as a tool is very helpful because it boils this act down into doable chunks (  ). 

As far as tools for creating Gesamstkunstwerk, I think initially of advertising via posters or social media, and how it informs how you approach a movie. I'm reminded of how a lot of brands use memes now as a form of promotion and something that came to mind is the Barbie/Oppenheimer meme from earlier last year. I don't believe this was an intentional marketing move on any part of the filmmakers, but it shows how memes create culture. In this case, Barbenheimer had a big impact on how many people experienced both films; some people made a day out of it and did a double feature, people created and sold merchandise about it. The two films are now linked by this meme and it sparked a genuine dialogue on the nature of social media and community. I'm not sure how well this example fits though because memes kind of evolve on their own, I'm not sure if anyone can be the "architect" of a meme.

Another contemporary tool for creating a Gesamstkunstwerk is web design/programming. Web designers quite literally have full control over how people interface with the contents of their site. If we look at the Rhizome Anthology site itself, the desicion to present information this way informs how we proccess it. The series is split into three chronological categories, it is color coded, information is chunked on individual pages etc. It also kind of functions as both an art "object" as well as an educational resource/index/gallery. 

The [Processing](https://anthology.rhizome.org/processing) project from the Rhizome site is cool because it highlights how long-term art projects become collaboarative and grow into larger things. The project grew into a non-profit and now people can not only use the tool, but can help support a good cause. This also reminds me of crowdfunding organizations like Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee. A lot of online creatives use these sites to literally make a living; people have the opportunity to directly help an artist they like, and these sites can functon as platforms for more communal, local conversations to happen; I think it can build genuine community online rather than a gross Twitter echo-chamber. Maybe it dips into parasocial territory, but not in a horrible, altering-your-brain-chemistry kind of way (I hope).
