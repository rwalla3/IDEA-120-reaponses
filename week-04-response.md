# Hot and Cold Media - examples  

Hot: Requires **little input** and engages just a **few senses**.  
Cold: Requires **a lot of engagement**; we have to **immerse ourselves** in the medium and **participate**.  

*Hot media example: Short form video (TikTok, YouTube Reels, etc.)*  
  Short form video content is an example of hot media because it requires very little effort to consume. These videos tend to be short and attention grabbing; paired with algorithms which generate personalized feeds, this kind of media is not difficult to engage with and appeals to our visual and auditory senses.

*Cold media example: Reading a book*   
  Books on the other hand are an example of cold media because they require long stretches of focused attention in order to digest. In the case of fiction, a reader tends to use their imagination and discernment skills to keep up with the story and engage meaningfully. People must also be literate in the language a book is written in.
